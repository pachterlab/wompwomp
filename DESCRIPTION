Description: Alluvial plots are great for visualizing the concordance between two different clustering methods applied to a dataset. However, these plots only allow for cluster agreement when each side of the bipartite graph is lined up in such a way that there is minimal cross-over between clusters, thus allowing one to visualize something analogous to an Adjusted Rand Index. alluvialmatch utilizes ggalluvial and igraph::max_bipartite_match in order to achieve this goal.
