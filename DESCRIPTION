Title: Optimizing alluvial plots
Authors@R: c(person("Joseph", "Rich", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "jmrich@caltech.edu"), person("Conrad", "Oakes", role = "aut", email = "coakes@caltech.edu"), person("Lior", "Pachter", role = "aut"))
Description: Alluvial plots are great for visualizing the concordance between two different clustering methods applied to a dataset. However, these plots only allow for cluster agreement when each side of the bipartite graph is lined up in such a way that there is minimal cross-over between clusters, thus allowing one to visualize something analogous to an Adjusted Rand Index. wompwomp utilizes ggalluvial and igraph::max_bipartite_match in order to achieve this goal.
